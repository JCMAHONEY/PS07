## GitHub Documents

Welcome to my first github! I am a current sophomore at Smith College studying Quantitative Economics and Statstical & Data sciences. 

## Sample of my work

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
library(Stat2Data)
data("Cereal")
```
Creating a model of the calories per serving of a cereal as a multiple regression function of the amount of sugar per serving (in grams).

```{r}
lR_cereal <- lm(Calories ~ Sugar, data = Cereal)
LR_Cereal_points <- get_regression_points(lR_cereal)
get_regression_table(lR_cereal)
```

## Including Plots

I will plot the model I created above on a scatterplot of the observed data points

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Cereal, aes(x = Sugar, y = Calories)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE)
```
